Hamdam is an Android appliation designed to allow women to track their menstruation cycles,
anticipate their periods and learn about women's health issues.

## Features ##

Hamdam features a menstruation calendar which allows users to input and track their periods, and
view projected period and ovulation days into the future. We also feature a daily questionnaire
or 'check-in' on mood, sleep quality, etc., and the option to set reminders for certain events
(such as a regular breast exam or medication reminder, and notifications when your period/PMS
may be coming up).
Hamdam also includes educational resources on sexual/reproductive health and domestic rights,
as well as information on a government-sponsored women's rights hotline (offered for users
in Iran only).
